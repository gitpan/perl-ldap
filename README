QUICK START GUIDE:

    perl-ldap uses the following modules/distributions.

	Convert::ASN1 - required
	URI::ldap     - optional, needed for URL parsing
	Digest::MD5   - optional, needed for SASL CRAM-MD5 auth

    First ensure the above modules/distributions are installed then
    build/test/install Net::LDAP by doing

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make test
            make install

    Several modules in the distribution contain documentation. Once installed
    you can use the 'perldoc Net::LDAP' command to obtain the documentation.
    This documentation will contain pointers to the other modules.


*******************************************************************************
NOTE: Everything that has been depricated will be removed when V1.00 is
released, but who knows when that will be.
