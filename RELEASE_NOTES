perl-ldap 0.16 April xx 2000
============================

* This is the first release which uses Convert::ASN1 instead of
  Convert::BER. This should show an increase in performance.
* Added support for LDAPv3 controls. Controls supported are
  - VirtualListView
  - Sort
  - Paged
* HTML version of the documentation is now included in the
  distribution
* Added Bundle::Net::LDAP
* Net::LDAP->schema can now be told where to search for the schema.

 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

  In a pre-release of 0.16 it has been seen that a search result may
  not contain all entries and $mesg->code will be LDAP_DECODING_ERROR.
  This has been seen when the client is running on NT or Linux and the
  server is an Exchange server.
