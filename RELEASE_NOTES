perl-ldap 0.19 June 8 2000
============================

* Fixed bug which caused 2nd and subsequent binds to be anonymous.
* Fixed bug in moddn.
* Fix bug which caused a call to ->pop_entry or ->shift_entry
  to hang forever.

perl-ldap 0.18 May 22 2000
============================

* Now passes -wc with 5.004, 5.005_03 and 5.6.0
* Bundle now correctly references Convert::ASN1 instead of
  the non-existant Convert::ASN
* Net::LDAP::Filter will now catch the case of unmatched
  ()'s and return an error
* as_struct, which was broken in the changeover to Convert::ASN1,
  now works again.

 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

 Test t/02filter.t fails with perl 5.6.0 compiled with threads enabled
 This is due to a bug in 5.6.0 when compiled with threads, see
 http://bugs.perl.org/perlbug.cgi?req=tidmids&tidmids=20000409.003&range=32323&format=h

perl-ldap 0.17 May 12 2000
============================

* Change to use asn_read instead of asn_resc. This seems to have
  fixed the known problem with 0.16
* Various bug fixes, see ChangeLog

perl-ldap 0.16 April 27 2000
============================

* This is the first release which uses Convert::ASN1 instead of
  Convert::BER. This should show an increase in performance.
* Added support for LDAPv3 controls. Controls supported are
  - VirtualListView
  - Sort
  - Paged
* HTML version of the documentation is now included in the
  distribution
* Added Bundle::Net::LDAP
* Net::LDAP->schema can now be told where to search for the schema.

 KNOWN PROBLEMS
 --------------

  In a pre-release of 0.16 it has been seen that a search result may
  not contain all entries and $mesg->code will be LDAP_DECODING_ERROR.
  This has been seen when the client is running on NT or Linux and the
  server is an Exchange server.
