<P>
The protocol described in this document is designed to provide access to
directories supporting the X.500 models, while not incurring the resource
requirements of the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP). This protocol is
specifically targeted at management applications and browser applications
that provide read/write interactive access to directories. When used with a
directory supporting the X.500 protocols, it is intended to be a complement
to the X.500 DAP.

<P>
The LDAP requires that the contents of AttributeValue fields in protocol
elements be octet strings. This document defines a set of syntaxes for
LDAPv3, and the rules by which attribute values of these syntaxes are
represented as octet strings for transmission in the LDAP protocol. The
syntaxes defined in this document are referenced by this and other
documents that define attribute types. This document also defines the set
of attribute types which LDAP servers should support.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2253_UTF_8_String_Representa">RFC-2253 UTF-8 String Representation of Distinguished Names</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2253.txt</A>


<P>
The X.500 Directory uses distinguished names as the primary keys to entries
in the directory. Distinguished Names are encoded in ASN.1 in the X.500
Directory protocols. In the LDAP, a string representation of distinguished
names is transferred. This specification defines the string format for
representing names, which is designed to give a clean representation of
commonly used distinguished names, while being able to represent any
distinguished name.

<H2><A NAME="RFC_2254_The_String_Representati">RFC-2254 The String Representation of LDAP Search Filters</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2254.txt</A>


<P>
The LDAP defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to
an LDAP server. Some applications may find it useful to have a common way
of representing these search filters in a human-readable form. This
document defines a human-readable string format for representing LDAP
search filters. This document replaces RFC 1960, extending the string LDAP
filter definition to include support for LDAPv3 extended match filters.

<P>
This document describes a format for an LDAP Uniform Resource Locator, and
describes an LDAP search operation performed to retrieve information from
an LDAP directory. It updates the LDAP URL format for LDAPv3. This document
also defines a second URL scheme prefix for LDAP running over the TLS
protocol.

<P>
This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object
classes defined by the ISO and ITU-T committees in the X.500 documents, in
particular those intended for use by directory clients. This is the most
widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema
definitions for white pages objects use it as a basis. This document does
not cover attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory
servers, nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T
documents.

<P>
This document defines a C language application program interface to LDAP,
which is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It defines compatible
synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit a wide variety of
applications. This document gives a brief overview of the LDAP model, then
an overview of how the API is used by an application program to obtain LDAP
information. The API calls are described in detail, followed by an appendix
that provides some example code demonstrating the use of the API.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2079_Definition_of_an_X_500_">RFC-2079 Definition of an X.500 Attribute Type and an Object Class to

<P>
URLs are being widely used to specify the location of Internet resources.
There is an urgent need to be able to include URLs in directories that
conform to the LDAP and X.500 information models, and a desire to include
other types of URIs as they are defined. A number of independent groups are
already experimenting with the inclusion of URLs in LDAP and X.500
directories. This document builds on the experimentation to date and
defines a new attribute type and an auxiliary object class to allow URIs,
including URLs, to be stored in directory entries in a standard way.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2164_Use_of_an_X_500_LDAP_di">RFC-2164 Use of an X.500/LDAP directory to support MIXER address mapping</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2164.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2164.txt</A>


<P>
MIXER (RFC 2156) defines an algorithm for use of a set of global mapping
between X.400 and RFC 822 addresses. This specification defines how to
represent and maintain these mappings (MIXER Conformant Global Address
Mappings of MCGAMs) in an X.500 or LDAP directory. Mechanisms for
representing OR Address and Domain hierarchies within the DIT. These
techniques are used to define two independent subtrees in the DIT, which
contain the mapping information.

<H2><A NAME="RFC_2218_A_Common_Schema_for_the">RFC-2218 A Common Schema for the Internet White Pages Service</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2218.txt</A>


<P>
This IETF Integrated Directory <CODE>Services(IDS)</CODE> Working Group
proposes a standard specification for a simple Internet White Pages service
by defining a common schema for use by the various White Pages servers.
This schema is independent of specific implementations of the White Pages
service. This document specifies the minimum set of core attributes of a
White Pages entry for an individual and describes how new objects with
those attributes can be defined and published. It does not describe how to
represent other objects in the White Pages service. Further, it does not
address the search sort expectations within a particular service.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2222_Simple_Authentication_a">RFC-2222 Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2222.txt</A>


<P>
This document describes a method for adding authentication support to
connection-based protocols. To use this specification, a protocol includes
a command for identifying and authenticating a user to a server and for
optionally negotiating protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If
its use is negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol
and the connection. This document describes how a protocol specifies such a
command, defines several mechanisms for use by the command, and defines the
protocol used for carrying a negotiated security layer over the connection.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2247_Using_Domains_in_LDAP_X">RFC-2247 Using Domains in LDAP/X.500 Distinguished Names</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2247.txt</A>


<P>
LDAP uses X.500-compatible distinguished names for providing unique
identification of entries. This document defines an algorithm by which a
name registered with the Internet Domain Name Service can be represented as
an LDAP distinguished name.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2307_An_Approach_for_Using_L">RFC-2307 An Approach for Using LDAP as a Network Information Service</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2307.txt</A>


<P>
This document describes an experimental mechanism for mapping entities
related to TCP/IP and the UNIX system into X.500 entries so that they may
be resolved with the LDAP. A set of attribute types and object classes are
proposed, along with specific guidelines for interpreting them. The
intention is to assist the deployment of LDAP as an organizational
nameservice. No proposed solutions are intended as standards for the
Internet. Rather, it is hoped that a general consensus will emerge as to
the appropriate solution to such problems, leading eventually to the
adoption of standards. The proposed mechanism has already been implemented
with some success.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="RFC_2559_Internet_X_509_Public_K">RFC-2559 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Operational Protocols
- LDAPv2</A></H2>
<P>
<A
HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2559.txt</A>


<P>
The protocol described in this document is designed to satisfy some of the
operational requirements within the Internet X.509 PKI. Specifically, this
document addresses requirements to provide access to PKI repositories for
the purposes of retrieving PKI information and managing that same
information. The mechanism described in this document is based on the
LDAPv2, defined in RFC 1777, defining a profile of that protocol for use
within the PKIX and updates encodings for certificates and revocation lists
from RFC 1778. Additional mechanisms addressing PKIX operational

The schema defined in this document is a minimal schema to support PKIX in
an LDAPv2 environment, as defined in RFC 2559. Only PKIX-specific

LDAP supports lightweight access to static directory services, allowing
relatively fast search and update access. Static directory services store
information about people that persists in its accuracy and value over a
long period of time. Dynamic directory services are different in that they
store information about people that only persists in its accuracy and value
while people are online. Though the protocol operations and attributes used
by dynamic directory services are similar to the ones used for static
directory services, clients that are bound to a dynamic directory service
need to periodically refresh their presence at the server to keep directory
entries from getting stale in the presence of client application crashes. A
flow control mechanism from the server is also described that allows a
server to inform clients how often they should refresh their presence.

LDAP provides a means for clients to interrogate and modify information
stored in a distributed directory system. The information in the directory
is maintained as attributes of entries. Most of these attributes have
syntaxes which are human-readable strings, and it is desirable to be able
to indicate the natural language associated with attribute values. This
document describes how language codes are carried in LDAP and are to be
interpreted by LDAP servers. All implementations MUST be prepared to accept
language codes in the LDAP protocols. Servers may or may not be capable of
storing attributes with language codes in the directory.

When scheduling a calendar entity, such as an event, it is a prerequisite
that an organizer has the calendar address of each attendee that will be
invited to the event. Additionally, access to an attendee's current ``busy
time'' provides an a priori indication of whether the attendee will be free
to participate in the event. In order to meet these challenges, a calendar
user agent (CUA) needs a mechanism to locate individual user's calendar and
free/busy time. This memo defines three mechanisms for obtaining a URI to a
user's calendar and free/busy time. These include:

<P>
This draft presents a LDAPv3 schema for the DMTF CIM Device model. It
builds on the core model presented in draft-moats-dmtf-core-ldap (v1).
Associations are mapped using a combination of auxiliary classes and DIT
structure rules. Where auxiliary classes are used, name form and DIT
content rules are specified. (This document is not a product of the DMTF,
and represents the view of the authors.)

<H2><A NAME="draft_moats_ldap_dereference_mat">draft-moats-ldap-dereference-match -- Extensible Match Rule to Dereference Pointers</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines a LDAPv3 extensible matching rule that allows a
server to dereference pointers stored in an object's attribute and apply a
LDAPv3 search filter to the resulting objects. This rule allows schema
definitions to capture richer association models without requiring extra
protocol exchanges or special client code.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_natarajan_ldapext_cachedre">draft-natarajan-ldapext-cachedresults -- The LDAP Caching model</A></H2>
<P>
Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network resources.
It is assumed that a directory is accessed for reading and searching data
more than for modification purposes. Under such assumptions, for
performance reasons, a mechanism for caching as a proxy which caches all
entries is desirable. This document describes a mechanism for caching
directory entries. This document also defines one operational attribute and
two controls required to be implemented for the caching model.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_natkovich_ldap_lcup_LDA">draft-natkovich-ldap-lcup -- LDAP Client Update Protocol</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines the LDAP Client Update Protocol (LCUP). The protocol
is intended to allow an LDAP client to synchronize with the content of a
directory information tree (DIT) stored by an LDAP server and to be
notified about the changes to that content.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_rharrison_lburp_LDAP_Bu">draft-rharrison-lburp -- LDAP Bulk Update/Replication Protocol</A></H2>
<P>
The LDAP Bulk Update/Replication Protocol (LBURP) described in this
document allows an LDAP client (a genuine client or an LDAP server acting
as a client) to perform a bulk update to a replica on an LDAP server. The
protocol groups a set of update operations using the LDAP framed protocol
requests defined in [FRAMING] to notify the client that the update
operations in the framed set are related. The update operations within the
framed set are LDAPv3 extended operations each encapsulating a sequence
number and one or more LDAPv3 update operations. The sequence number allows
the server to process the update operations in the proper order even when
they are sent asynchronously by the client, and the update operations can
be grouped within the extended request to maximize the efficiency of
client-server communication.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_rharrison_ldap_extpartresp">draft-rharrison-ldap-extpartresp -- Extended Partial Response Protocol Enhancement to LDAPv3</A></H2>
<P>
This document describes the ExtendedPartialResponse, an element of LDAP v3
protocol which allows multiple responses to LDAPv3 extended requests.
Extended partial responses are backward compatible with the existing LDAPv3
Extended Operation defined in LDAPv3..

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_salzr_ldap_repsig_LDAP_">draft-salzr-ldap-repsig -- LDAP Controls for Reply Signatures</A></H2>
<P>
In many environments the final step of certificate issuance is publishing
the certificate to a repository. Unfortunately, there is no way for a
Certification Authority (CA) to have a secure application-level
acknowledgement that the proper repository did, in fact, receive the
certificate. This issue is of greater concern when considering the
publication of Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) -- if an adversary
manages to interpose itself between the CA and its intended repository,
then clients could end up relying on outdated revocation lists.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_smith_ldap_c_api_ext_lderr">draft-smith-ldap-c-api-ext-lderrno -- C LDAP API LDERRNO Extension</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines an extension to the C LDAP API to support reporting
of specific errors for functions in the API that do not provide a way to
access detailed information about failures. Three new functions are
defined: <CODE>ldap_get_lderrno(),</CODE> <CODE>ldap_set_lderrno(),</CODE>
and <CODE>ldap_dup_string().</CODE>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_smith_ldap_c_api_ext_vlv_">draft-smith-ldap-c-api-ext-vlv -- LDAP C API Virtual List View Extension (VLV)</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines a virtual list view extension for the LDAP C API to
support the LDAP protocol extensions for scrolling view browsing of search
results. More specifically, this document defines functions to create
virtual list view request controls and to parse virtual list view response
controls.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_smith_ldapv3_filter_update">draft-smith-ldapv3-filter-update -- The String Representation of LDAP Search Filters</A></H2>
<P>
LDAP defines a network representation of a search filter transmitted to an
LDAP server. Some applications may find it useful to have a common way of
representing these search filters in a human-readable form. This document
defines a human-readable string format for representing the full range of
possible LDAPv3 search filters, including extended match filters.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_smith_ldapv3_url_update_">draft-smith-ldapv3-url-update -- The LDAP URL Format</A></H2>
<P>
LDAP is defined in RFCs 2251-3. This document describes a format for an
LDAP Uniform

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_wahl_ldap_adminaddr_Adm">draft-wahl-ldap-adminaddr -- Administrator Address Attribute</A></H2>
<P>
Organizations running multiple directory servers need an ability for
administrators to determine who is responsible for a particular server.
This is conceptually similar to the 'sysContact' object of SNMP. The
administratorsAddress attribute allows a server administrator to provide
the contact information of the responsible party for an LDAP server. This
can be used by management clients which are, for example, checking the
state of a replication or referral topology, to provide a way for the user
of the management client to send email to manager of a particular server.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_wahl_ldap_digest_example_">draft-wahl-ldap-digest-example -- An Example of DIGEST-MD5 Authentication within an LDAP server</A></H2>
<P>
HTTP Digest Authentication as a SASL mechanism is required to be supported
in LDAP servers for password-based authentication (see Authentication
Methods for LDAP). This specification describes one approach to implement
DIGEST-MD5 authentication in an LDAP server. It does not specify a standard
of any kind.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_weltman_java_sasl_The_J">draft-weltman-java-sasl -- The Java SASL Application Program Interface</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines a client-side and a server-side Java language
interface for using the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
mechanisms for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.
The interface promotes sharing of SASL mechanism drivers and security
layers between applications using different protocols. It complements but
does not replace [SASL], which defines and exemplifies use of the SASL
protocol in a language-independent way.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_weltman_ldap_java_controls">draft-weltman-ldap-java-controls -- Java LDAP Controls</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines support for the Preferred Language Control, the
Server Sorting Control, and the Virtual List Control in the Java LDAP API.
Controls are an LDAPv3 extension, to allow passing arbitrary control
information along with a standard request to a server, and to receive
arbitrary information back with a standard result.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_weltman_ldapv3_auth_respon">draft-weltman-ldapv3-auth-response -- LDAP Authentication Response Control</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines support for the Authentication Response Control.
Controls are an LDAPv3 extension, to allow passing arbitrary control
information along with a standard request to a server, and to receive
arbitrary information back with a standard result. The Authentication
Response Control may be returned by an LDAP server in a bind response to a
client authenticating with LDAPv3. The control contains the identity
assumed by the client. This is useful when there is a mapping step or other
indirection during the bind, so that the client can be told what LDAP
identity was granted. Client authentication with certificates is the
primary situation where this applies. Also, some SASL authentication
mechanisms may not involve the client explicitly providing a DN.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_weltman_ldapv3_proxy_LD">draft-weltman-ldapv3-proxy -- LDAP Proxied Authorization Control</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines support for the Proxied Authorization Control.
Controls are an LDAPv3 extension, to allow passing arbitrary control
information along with a standard request to a server, and to receive
arbitrary information back with a standard result. The Proxied
Authorization Control allows a connection with sufficient privileges to
assume the identity of another entry for the duration of an LDAP request.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_authpasswd_">draft-zeilenga-ldap-authpasswd -- LDAP Authentication Password Attribute</A></H2>
<P>
This document describes schema for storing authentication passwords in an
LDAP directory. The document provides schema definitions for authPassword
and related schema definitions. The authPassword is intended to used
instead of clear text password storage mechanisms such as userPassword
[RFC2256] to support simple bind operations. The attribute may be used to
store SASL authentication passwords in entries of a directory.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_c_api_concur">draft-zeilenga-ldap-c-api-concurrency -- LDAP C API Concurrency Extensions</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines extensions to the LDAP C API to support use in
concurrent execution environments. The document describes and defines
requirements for multiple concurrency levels: thread safe, session thread
safe, and operation thread safe.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_c_api_errno_">draft-zeilenga-ldap-c-api-errno -- LDAP C API Error Reporting Extension</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines a mandatory extension to the LDAP C API to provide
error reporting for all API calls. The mechanism is non-intrusive and can,
optionally, support concurrent execution environments.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_grouping_">draft-zeilenga-ldap-grouping -- LDAPv3: Grouping of Related Operations</A></H2>
<P>
This document provides a general mechanisms for grouping related LDAP
operations, which may be used to support replication, proxies, and higher
level operations such as transactions. This document describes a set of
LDAP extended operations and other protocol and schema elements to support
grouping of related operations.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_namedref_">draft-zeilenga-ldap-namedref -- Named References in LDAP Directories</A></H2>
<P>
This document defines schema and protocol elements for representing and
manipulating generic knowledge information in LDAP directories. An
attribute type ``ref'' is used to store URIs which may refer to LDAP and
non-LDAP services. An object class ``referral'' is used to construct
entries in an LDAP directory which references to other directories or
services. A control, ManageDsaIT, is defined to allow clients to manipulate
referral objects as normal entries. The document describes procedures
directory servers should follow when supporting these elements.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_passwd_exop_">draft-zeilenga-ldap-passwd-exop -- LDAP Password Modify Extended Operation</A></H2>
<P>
The integration of LDAP and external authentication services has
introducted non-DN authentication identities and allowed for non-directory
storage of passwords. As such, mechanisms which update the directory, such
as Modify operation, cannot be used to change a user's password. This
document describes an LDAP extended operation to allow modification of user
passwords which is not dependent upon the form of the authentication
identity nor the password storage mechanism used.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldap_txn_LDAPv">draft-zeilenga-ldap-txn -- LDAPv3 Transactions</A></H2>
<P>
LDAP update operations have atomic properties upon individual entries.
However, it is often desirable to update two or more entries as one atomic
action, a transaction. Transactions are necessary to support a number of
applications including resource provisioning and information replication.
This document defines an LDAP extension to support transactions.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="draft_zeilenga_ldapv3bis_opattrs">draft-zeilenga-ldapv3bis-opattrs -- LDAPv3: All Operational Attributes</A></H2>
<P>
X.500 provides a mechanism for clients to request all operational
attributes be returned with entries provided in response to a search
operation. LDAP [RFC2251] does not provide a similar mechanism to clients
to request the return of operational attributes. The lack of such a
mechanisms hinders discovery of operational attributes present in an entry.
