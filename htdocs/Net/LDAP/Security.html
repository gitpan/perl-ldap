Net::LDAP::Security - Security issues with LDAP connections

<P>

<P>
This document discusses various security issues relating to using LDAP and
connecting to LDAP servers, notably how to manage these potential
vulnerabilities:

<UL>
<LI>
<P>
do you know that you are connected to the right server

<LI>
<P>
can someone sniff your passwords/userids from the directory connection

<LI>
<P>
can someone sniff other confidential information from the directory
connection

</UL>
<P>
<STRONG>Net::LDAP</STRONG> provides ways to address these vulnerabilities: through the use of LDAPS,
or LDAPv3 and TLS, and/or the use of SASL. Each of these will be explained
below.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_does_an_LDAP_connection_work">How does an LDAP connection work</A></H2>
<P>
A normal LDAPv2 or LDAPv3 connection works by the client connecting
directly to port 389 (by default), and then issuing various LDAP requests
like search, add, etc.

<P>
There is no way to guarantee that an LDAP client is connected to the right
LDAP server. Hackers could have poisoned your DNS, so 'ldap.example.com'
could be made to point to 'ldap.hacker.com'. Or they could have installed
their own server on the correct machine.

<P>
It is in the nature of the LDAP protocol that all information goes between
the client and the server in 'plain text'. This is a term used by
cryptographers to describe unencrypted and recoverable data, so even though
LDAP can transfer binary values like JPEG photographs, audio clips and
X.509 certificates, everything is still considered 'plain text'.

<P>
If these vulnerabilities are an issue to, then you should consider the
other possibilities described below, namely LDAPS, LDAPv3 and TLS, and
SASL.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_does_an_LDAPS_connection_wor">How does an LDAPS connection work</A></H2>
<P>
LDAPS is an unofficial protocol. It is to LDAP what HTTPS is to HTTP,
namely the exact same protocol (but in this case LDAPv2 or LDAPv3) running
over a <EM>secured</EM> SSL (``Secure Socket Layer'') connection to port 636 (by default).

<P>
Not all servers will be configured to listen for LDAPS connections, but if
they do, it will commonly be on a different port from the normal plain text
LDAP port.

<P>
Using LDAPS can <EM>potentially</EM> solve the vulnerabilities described above, but you should be aware that
simply ``using'' SSL is not a magic bullet that automatically makes your
system ``secure''.

<P>
First of all, LDAPS can solve the problem of verifying that you are
connected to the correct server. When the client and server connect, they
perform a special SSL 'handshake', part of which involves the server and
client exchanging cryptographic keys, which are described using X.509
certificates. If the client wishes to confirm that it is connected to the
correct server, all it needs to do is verify the server's certificate which
is sent in the handshake. This is done in two ways:

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
check that the certificate is signed (trusted) by someone that you trust,
and that the certificate hasn't been revoked. For instance, the server's
certificate may have been signed by Verisign (www.verisign.com), and you
decide that you want to trust Verisign to sign legitimate certificates.

<LI>
<P>
check that the least-significant cn RDN in the server's certificate's DN is
the fully-qualified hostname of the hostname that you connected to when
creating the LDAPS object. For example if the server is
&lt;cn=ldap.example.com,ou=My department,o=My company&gt;, then the RDN to
check is cn=ldap.example.com.

</OL>
<P>
You can do this by using the cafile and capath options when creating a
<STRONG>Net::LDAPS</STRONG> object, <EM>and</EM> by setting the verify option to 'require'.

<P>
To prevent hackers 'sniffing' passwords and other information on your
connection, you also have to make sure the encryption algorithm used by the
SSL connection is good enough. This is also something that gets decided by
the SSL handshake - if the client and server cannot agree on an acceptable
algorithm the connection is not made.

<P>
<STRONG>Net::LDAPS</STRONG> will by default use all the algorithms built into your copy of OpenSSL,
except for ones considered to use ``low'' strength encryption, and those
using export strength encryption. You can override this when you create the <STRONG>Net::LDAPS</STRONG> object using the 'ciphers' option.

<P>
Once you've made the secure connection, you should also check that the
encryption algorithm that is actually being used is one that you find
acceptable. Broken servers have been observed in the field which 'fail
over' and give you an unencrypted connection, so you ought to check for
that.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_does_LDAP_and_TLS_work">How does LDAP and TLS work</A></H2>
<P>
SSL is a good solution to many network security problems, but it is not a
standard. The IETF corrected some defects in the SSL mechanism and
published a standard called RFC 2246 which describes TLS (``Transport Layer
Security''), which is simply a cleaned up and standardized version of SSL.

<P>
You can only use TLS with an LDAPv3 server. That is because the standard
(RFC 2830) for LDAP and TLS requires that the <EM>normal</EM> LDAP connection (ie., on port 389) can be switched on demand from plain
text into a TLS connection. The switching mechanism uses a special extended
LDAP operation, and since these are not legal in LDAPv2, you can only
switch to TLS on an LDAPv3 connection.

<P>
So the way you use TLS with LDAPv3 is that you create your normal LDAPv3
connection using <CODE>Net::LDAP::new()</CODE>, and then you perform the switch using <CODE>Net::LDAP::start_tls()</CODE>. The <CODE>start_tls()</CODE> method takes pretty much the same arguments as <CODE>Net::LDAPS::new()</CODE>, so check above for details.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="How_does_SASL_work">How does SASL work</A></H2>
<P>
SASL is an authentication framework that can be used by a number of
different Internet services, including LDAPv3. Because it is only a
framework, it doesn't provide any way to authenticate by itself; to
actually authenticate to a service you need to use a specific SASL
<EM>mechanism</EM>. A number of mechanisms are defined, such as CRAM-MD5.

<P>
The use of a mechanism like CRAM-MD5 provides a solution to the password
sniffing vulnerability, because these mechanisms typically do not require
the user to send across a secret (eg., a password) in the clear across the
network. Instead, authentication is carried out in a clever way which
avoids this, and so prevents passwords from being sniffed.

<P>
<STRONG>Net::LDAP</STRONG> supports SASL using the <STRONG>Authen::SASL</STRONG> class. Currently the only <STRONG>Authen::SASL</STRONG> subclasses (ie., SASL mechanism) available are CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL.

<P>
Some SASL mechanisms provide a general solution to the sniffing of all data
on the network vulnerability, as they can negotiate confidential (ie.,
encrypted) network connections. Note that this is over and above any SSL or
TLS encryption! Unfortunately, perl's <STRONG>Authen::SASL</STRONG> code cannot negotiate this.
