Net::LDAP::LDIF - LDIF reading and writing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::LDAP::LDIF;

  $ldif = Net::LDAP::LDIF->new( "file.ldif", "r" );
  while( $entry = $ldif->read() ) {
	  # Do things with $entry
  }
  $ldif->done();

  $ldif = Net::LDAP::LDIF->new( $fh, "r" );
  @entries = $ldif->read();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Net::LDAP::LDIF> provides a means to convert between
L<Net::LDAP::Entry|Net::LDAP::Entry> objects and LDAP entries represented
in LDIF format files. Reading and writing are supported and may manipulate
single entries or lists of entries.

As when reading an entire file into memory with perl normally, take into
account the possibility of memory use when loading an LDIF file in one go.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over 4

=item new ( [ FILE [, MODE [,OPTIONS ]]] )

FILE may be the name of a file or an already open filehandle. If a filename
is passed in then it will be opened with the mode specified.

MODE defaults to "r" for read. You may specify "w" to for write+truncate or
"a" for write+append.

OPTIONS is a list of key-value pairs. Valid options are:

=over 8

=item encode

some values in LDIF cannot be written verbatim and have to be encoded
in some way. This option lets you specify how. Valid encoding options
are 'none' (the default), 'canonical' (see
L<Net::LDAP::Util/canonical_dn>), or 'base64'.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item read

=over 4

In a similar fashion to the perl <$fh> operator, read will read one entry or
the entire file depending on whether it is called in a scalar or array context.

=back

=item read_cmd

=item write ( ENTRIES )

=item write_cmd ( ENTRIES )

=item done

=over 4

This method signals that the LDIF object is no longer needed. If a file was
opened automatically when the object was created it will be closed. This
method is called automatically via DESTROY when the object goes out of scope.

  $ldif->done();
